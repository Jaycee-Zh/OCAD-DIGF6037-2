## Rules Notes V2
Initial poll: See who has chrome, priority for phone pets
Quickly explain it, then direct the 12 phone holders to the table, direct the humans to spread around the room

Minute at the end for prize, raise hand if you have 6 pictures and who has stickers

12 of you will be given phone costumes and you have 1min30sec to decorate your pet

Turn off the rotation lock on your phone and turn it horizontally. Please also ensure you have turned your phone off of silent mode and turned up your brightness and volume to the maximum value. Scan the QR code on your phone costume and please allow permission for your sensors and microphone to be used.  

Those without a phone, your goal is to mimic the pitches produced by the phone pets to attempt to converse with them. If you are successful, the pet will speak to you in its language and you can continue exchanging sounds. You can receive stickers from phone holders if you successfully have a conversation with their phone pet. If the pet doesnâ€™t want to talk to you, you must move on.

Those with a phone, your goal is to talk to as many other humans and phone pets as possible. To approach someone with a phone, you must place your two phone pets facing each other on a flat surface. The phones have to be stationary to emit their first pitch to see if they want to talk to each other. If you approach a human, your phone pet must also be placed stationary but the human can stand in front of it and talk to the phone that way.

There are points based on how many conversations you have, so talk to as many humans and pets as you can! The points appear in the heart bar at the top of your phone screen, it shows how happy your pet is to talk to people. 

Take a selfie by tapping the screen after each conversation you have to document the interaction.
